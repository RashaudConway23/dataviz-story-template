          <h2>Section 1</h2>
          <p class="lead">Introduction</p>
          <p> For many residents of Connecticut, where their trash ends up is a question that is ill-defined. What we know is that we place our trash and recycling in color-coded bins and it is then loaded into trucks, never to be seen again. But where does our waste actually go? We assume that the recycling is “recycled” and the trash is disposed of, but where and how are these resources actually processed? This is an important question because our research has revealed new environmental and economic problems that the state of Connecticut is facing since the closing of the <a href="https://www.ctmira.org/">Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority (MIRA).</a></p>
        
          <p class="lead">Findings & Evidence</p>
          <p> Connecticut produces 2.4 million tons of waste per year, and at one point, was fully self-sufficient with its waste. Since the closing of MIRA in Hartford, Connecticut in 2022, which processed 720,000 tons per year, state representatives have been searching for alternative measures to deal with this problem.</p>

           <p> The band-aid solution that is currently being employed is shipping out waste to landfills in other states. One being the Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore Pennsylvania which is almost 200 miles away and takes trucks upwards of 4 hours to commute. Another landfill utilized by Connecticut is the Tunnel Hill Reclamation Landfill in New Lexington, Ohio. Waste is brought to this facility via train cars which can dispose of up to 150 tons of trash every 15 minutes. Both of these solutions are environmentally and economically disastrous. MIRA was previously able to take this trash and turn it into usable energy, but that is no longer the case. Recyclables are also not being recycled, because what used to be a profitable incentive is now not. The rate for recycling has become so low that it is not worth the time or effort to sort the waste or to put another truck on the road. Haulers have been seen dumping municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling because the tip fee for recycling has exceeded the $20 cost to dump the MSW. We have also found little on how composting fits into Connecticut waste. There is one pilot program in Meriden, Connecticut that has shown promising participation results where trash and food scraps are separated via color-coded bags. The bags are separated and food scraps go to Quantum Biopower in Southington where it is converted into energy through anaerobic digestion to biogas and fertilizer. While this project is small scale, it is an encouraging step towards more consciousness from consumers and as an economic and energy source.</p>

          <p> In Figure 1 below, since our project is a github website, we didn't have to make a data visualization. However, to show I know how to add one, I'll attach a random data visualization from one of our past projects.

          <h2>Section 2</h2>
          <p>The sources in our quest to understand and pinpoint where Connecticut trash is ending up relies on articles written about the topic. The CT Mirror, a Connecticut news source has many articles on the subject of waste and waste management. Mark Pazniokas, co-founder of the CT Mirror, has contributed the most to our search of where trash ends up. Our project is unique in that it is less about numerical data as it is about research and telling a compelling story. While there are numerical values that help us understand the problem, they do not fully explain the story of where our waste actually ends up. One limitation that we have run into so far is how Hartford trash alone is processed. We have an understanding of Connecticut’s trash disposal practices as a whole, but little focus has been paid to Hartford as its own entity. Another limitation is composting. We have found one article on a pilot program in Meriden, Connecticut that has shown promising results, but there seems to be little outside of that.</p>
          <p> Since our project is a github website, we didn't have to make a data visualization. However, to show I know how to add one, I'll attach a random data visualization from one of our past projects.
          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future DataViz students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, such as <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/'>CT EdSight</a>, and also link to your shared Google Sheets.</p>

          <h2>Section 3</h2>
          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
