          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p class="lead">Introduction</p>
          <p> For many residents of Connecticut, where their trash ends up is a question that is ill-defined. What we know is that we place our trash and recycling in color-coded bins and it is then loaded into trucks, never to be seen again. But where does our waste actually go? We assume that the recycling is “recycled” and the trash is disposed of, but where and how are these resources actually processed? This is an important question because our research has revealed new environmental and economic problems that the state of Connecticut is facing since the closing of the <a href="https://www.ctmira.org/">Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority (MIRA).</a></p>
        
          <p class="lead">Findings & Evidence</p>
          <p> Connecticut produces 2.4 million tons of waste per year, and at one point, was fully self-sufficient with its waste. Since the closing of MIRA in Hartford, Connecticut in 2022, which processed 720,000 tons per year, state representatives have been searching for alternative measures to deal with this problem.</p>

           <p> The band-aid solution that is currently being employed is shipping out waste to landfills in other states. One being the Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore Pennsylvania which is almost 200 miles away and takes trucks upwards of 4 hours to commute. Another landfill utilized by Connecticut is the Tunnel Hill Reclamation Landfill in New Lexington, Ohio. Waste is brought to this facility via train cars which can dispose of up to 150 tons of trash every 15 minutes. Both of these solutions are environmentally and economically disastrous. MIRA was previously able to take this trash and turn it into usable energy, but that is no longer the case. Recyclables are also not being recycled, because what used to be a profitable incentive is now not. The rate for recycling has become so low that it is not worth the time or effort to sort the waste or to put another truck on the road. Haulers have been seen dumping municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling because the tip fee for recycling has exceeded the $20 cost to dump the MSW. We have also found little on how composting fits into Connecticut waste. There is one pilot program in Meriden, Connecticut that has shown promising participation results where trash and food scraps are separated via color-coded bags. The bags are separated and food scraps go to Quantum Biopower in Southington where it is converted into energy through anaerobic digestion to biogas and fertilizer. While this project is small scale, it is an encouraging step towards more consciousness from consumers and as an economic and energy source.</p>

          <p> In Figure 1 below, since our project is a github website, we didn't have to make a data visualization. However, to show I know how to add one, I'll attach a random data visualization from one of our past projects. </p>

          <h2>Sources & Methods</h2>
          <p>The sources in our quest to understand and pinpoint where Connecticut trash is ending up relies on articles written about the topic. The CT Mirror, a Connecticut news source has many articles on the subject of waste and waste management. Mark Pazniokas, co-founder of the CT Mirror, has contributed the most to our search of where trash ends up. Our project is unique in that it is less about numerical data as it is about research and telling a compelling story. While there are numerical values that help us understand the problem, they do not fully explain the story of where our waste actually ends up. One limitation that we have run into so far is how Hartford trash alone is processed. We have an understanding of Connecticut’s trash disposal practices as a whole, but little focus has been paid to Hartford as its own entity. Another limitation is composting. We have found one article on a pilot program in Meriden, Connecticut that has shown promising results, but there seems to be little outside of that.</p>
